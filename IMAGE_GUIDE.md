# Adding Images to Your Portfolio Website

## 📁 Image Directory Structure

I've created two directories for your images:
- `/public/images/profile/` - For your profile/headshot photos
- `/public/images/projects/` - For project screenshots and demos

## 🖼️ How to Add Your Images

### Method 1: Drag & Drop (Easiest)
1. Open Finder and navigate to your project folder
2. Go to `public/images/profile/` or `public/images/projects/`
3. Drag and drop your images into the appropriate folder
4. Rename them to something simple like:
   - `profile.jpg` or `headshot.png`
   - `project1.png`, `project2.png`, etc.

### Method 2: Terminal
```bash
# Copy your profile image
cp /path/to/your/photo.jpg public/images/profile/profile.jpg

# Copy project images
cp /path/to/project-screenshot.png public/images/projects/project1.png
```

## 📝 Where Images Will Be Used

### Profile Image
- **Location**: About page (`/about`)
- **Recommended size**: 400x400px (square)
- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Name it**: `profile.jpg` or `profile.png`

### Project Images
- **Location**: Projects page (`/projects`)
- **Recommended size**: 1200x800px (landscape) or 800x800px (square)
- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WEBP
- **Name them**: `project1.png`, `project2.png`, etc.
  - Or use descriptive names like `ecommerce-platform.png`

## ✅ Next Steps

Once you add your images:
1. Place them in the appropriate folders
2. Let me know and I'll update the website code to display them
3. I'll add proper image components with:
   - Lazy loading for performance
   - Alt text for accessibility
   - Hover effects and animations
   - Responsive sizing

## 💡 Image Tips

- **Optimize images** before adding (use tools like TinyPNG or Squoosh)
- Keep file sizes under 500KB for fast loading
- Use consistent aspect ratios for a polished look
- Consider using modern formats like WEBP for better compression
